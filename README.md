# Dynamical Low Rank Approximation (DLRA) for Heat Equation with Random Coefficient

This repository contains code implementing the **Dynamical Low Rank Approximation (DLRA)** method, applied to the heat equation with random coefficients. DLRA is a powerful computational method used to reduce the dimensionality of time-dependent problems, particularly those involving uncertainty or randomness.


## DLRA Theories

For a theoretical foundation of Dynamical Low Rank Approximation, please refer to the accompanying slides.
